<h1>Peter's Movie Criticisms</h1>
<h2>My impromptu movie review</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
An epic that might be a bit slow at times but is overall a great trilogy.
</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>
Arguably the best well-rounded movie ever made.
</p>

<h3>Sharknado</h3>
<p>
A movie so bad that it's good.
